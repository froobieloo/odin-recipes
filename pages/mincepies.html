    <strong>Makes: </strong>18 pies
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>225g cold butter, diced</li>
        <li>350g plain flour</li>
        <li>100g golden caster sugar</li>
        <li>280g mincemeat</li>
        <li>1 small egg, beaten</li>
        <li>icing sugar, to dust</li>
     
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>STEP 1</strong></p>
        To make the pastry, rub the butter into the flour, then mix in the golden caster sugar and a pinch of salt.</li>
        
        <li><p><strong>STEP 2</strong></p>
        Combine the pastry into a ball – don’t add liquid – and knead it briefly. The dough will be fairly firm, like shortbread dough. You can use the dough immediately, or chill for later.</li>
        
        <li><p><strong>STEP 3</strong></p>
        Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line 18 holes of two 12-hole patty tins, by pressing small walnut-sized balls of pastry into each hole.</li>
        
        <li><p><strong>STEP 4</strong></p>
        Spoon the mincemeat into the pies. Take slightly smaller balls of pastry than before and pat them out between your hands to make round lids, big enough to cover the pies.</li>
        
        <li><p><strong>STEP 5</strong></p>
        Top the pies with their lids, pressing the edges gently together to seal – you don’t need to seal them with milk or egg as they will stick on their own. Will keep frozen for up to one month.</li>
        
        <li><p><strong>STEP 6</strong></p>
        Brush the tops of the pies with the beaten egg. Bake for 20 mins until golden. Leave to cool in the tin for 5 mins, then remove to a wire rack. To serve, lightly dust with the icing sugar. Will keep for three to four days in an airtight container.</li>
