    <h3>Method</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>STEP 1</strong></p>
        Put 1kg mixed dried fruit, the zest and juice of 1 orange and 1 lemon, 150ml brandy or other alcohol, 250g softened butter and 200g light, soft brown sugar in a large pan set over a medium heat.</li>
        
        <li><p><strong>STEP 2</strong></p>
        Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 5 mins. Tip the fruit mixture into a large bowl and leave to cool for 30 mins.</li>
        
        <li><p><strong>STEP 3</strong></p>
        Heat oven to 150C/130C fan/gas 2. Line a deep 20cm cake tin with a double layer of baking parchment, then wrap a double layer of newspaper around the outside – tie with string to secure.</li>
        
        <li><p><strong>STEP 4</strong></p>
        Add 175g plain flour, 100g ground almonds, ½ tsp baking powder, 2 tsp mixed spice, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, ¼ tsp ground cloves, 100g flaked almonds, 4 large eggs and 1 tsp vanilla extract to the fruit mixture and stir well, making sure there are no pockets of flour.</li>
        
        <li><p><strong>STEP 5</strong></p>
        Tip into your prepared tin, level the top with a spatula and bake in the centre of the oven for 2 hrs.</li>
        
        <li><p><strong>STEP 6</strong></p>
        Remove the cake from the oven, poke holes in it with a skewer and spoon over 2 tbsp of your chosen alcohol. Leave the cake to cool completely in the tin.</li>
        
        <li><p><strong>STEP 7</strong></p>
        To store, peel off the baking parchment, then wrap well in cling film. Feed the cake with 1-2 tbsp alcohol every fortnight, until you ice it.</li>
        
        <li><p><strong>STEP 8</strong></p>
        Don’t feed the cake for the final week to give the surface a chance to dry before icing.</li>
