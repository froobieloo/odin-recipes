    <p>Shortbread is a fantastic treat all year round. Baked in homes all over the country, it's been a well loved treat for centuries.
        Popular in Scotland since the 12th century, this biscuit is often found around tables and under many a tree at Christmas time. 
        I love them when they're still warm, fresh out of the oven, but you've got to be quick in our house!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>150g plain flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>100g butter, chilled and cubed</li>
        <li>50g caster sugar, plus 1 tbsp for sprinkling</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven 170C/150C fan/gas 3. Put the flour, butter and sugar into a mixing bowl. Use your hands to combine the ingredients until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs, then squeeze until it comes together as a dough.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll out the dough to Â½ cm thick. Cut the dough into fingers and place on a lined baking tray. Use a fork to create imprints, then sprinkle with the remaining caster sugar.</li>
        <li>Chill the dough in the fridge for 20 mins, then bake for 15-20 mins until golden brown. Remove the shortbread fingers from the oven and leave to cool on the tray for 10 mins.</li>
    </ol>
