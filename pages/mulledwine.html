    <p>The gentle, even heat from a slow cooker means the mulled wine doesn't boil and the flavours stay fresh, leave it to heat while you eat, drink and be merry!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 x 750ml bottles red wine</li>
        <li>100ml Cointreau</li>
        <li>peeled zest and juice of 2 large oranges</li>
        <li>pared zest of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>120g golden caster sugar</li>
        <li>2 cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>3 star anise</li>
        <li>4 cloves</li>
        <li>slices of orange</li>
    
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>STEP 1</strong></p>
            Put all the ingredients (except the slices of orange) in a slow cooker on low for 1 1/2 - 2hrs until hot. Ladle into heatproof glasses and serve with slices of orange. <em>Using the 'keep warm' setting (if your cooker has one) will ensure the mulled wine stays hot during the party.</em></li>
